    <h3>Installation Hints</h3>
    <p>A proper installation requires 3 cables to be well connected:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>RED WIRE: Has to be connected to a line that ALWAYS has power, even when the vehicle is OFF.</li>
        <li>BLACK WIRE: Has to be connected to a good ground on the vehicle.</li>
        <li>WHITE WIRE: Has to be connected to a source that only has 12+ volts DC when the vehicle’s Ignition is ON. This is a very important connection as it determines the behavior of the device.</li>
    </ul>
