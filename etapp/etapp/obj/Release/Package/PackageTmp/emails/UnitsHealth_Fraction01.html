  <h2>Devices with Power Cut events</h2>
    <p>The following devices are loosing power one or more times a day.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:900;">Cause:</span> The RED wire is not connected to a constant power supply. For instance, The RED Wire could be connected to an aux line, which has no power when the vehicle is off.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:900;">Solution:</span> Make sure that the RED wire is connected to a source that ALWAYS has power (12+ VDC, 200+ mA), even when the vehicle is OFF.</p>
