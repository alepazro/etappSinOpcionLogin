    <h2>Case: Devices with no Ignition events</h2>
    <p>With a properly installed device you should see Ignition ON / Ignition OFF events every time the vehicle is turned on or off.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:900;">Cause:</span> The WHITE wire is not connected to a source that shows 12+ volts when the vehicle ignition is ON. </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:900;">Solution:</span> Make sure that the WHITE wire is connected to a line that ONLY has power when the vehicle is ON.</p>
